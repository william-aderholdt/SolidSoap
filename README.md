This freelance project was complete for a start-up environmentally friendly shampoo/conditioner company.  At the time of requesting the website, the company did not have a logo or brand color scheme.  I worked with the company to develop their logo, color template, and website design idea. 

Solid Soap is a company which had the great idea of producing shampoos and conditioners in a solid form to cut out chemicals which impact the environment.  Often bars of soap are considered only for body wash, but they found a way to product them for hair products as well.

The most important thing to this company was to keep the website as simple as possible. They wanted an image for the hero-image which expressed clean and fresh.  The colors they wanted were "natural" and "things you would find in nature".  They did not want a very expressive logo, but something simple which would be easily remembered.

Upon completing the project they said, "This website is exactly as I imagined it would be.  From the colors, to the layout.  It is simple, clean, and effective -- just like our product."

This project used React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS/SCSS.
